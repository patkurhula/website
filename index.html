  <p>This page was founded by a young teenager known as Pat Kurhula Ngoneni.DILA(day in the life of a teenager)Was founded to help connect parents with their young teenagers,while jumping in and learning about in this website.</p>
<p>Its hard being a teen especially in a world where how you are supposed to live is decided by either your parents or the elders around you.Not all teens can change that scenario and be able to live their lives their way and those who manage to,are  sometimes judged and labeled as disrespectful simply becuase they speak their minds out.All this leads to what we call a person's character or teenager behaviour,which most parents fail to understan and also endup losing their young-adults to that mishap.No im not saying we dont need guidance or we are the right ones, im saying parennts understand us better and then guide us. </p>

  <p><strong>Question?:How will the website or its creator chose to accomplish this</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>What influences our behaiours #1:</strong>We learn from those who live with,it would be rude if i told my mom that im just like her in an argument but truth be told I am, maybe i am a little wild but a part of my character is a reflection of hers.NO I havent forgetten about my peers and other influences.</p>
  <p><strong>when do we reveal ourselves#2:</strong>I believe when we were young would be free not afraid to express ourselves(majority)an observant parent should be able to their child from that time,to notice any changes in their behaviours. We wont be able to open up as teens to our parents how do you tell a saint that you've sinned,how can we be expected to show<i> PERFECTION</i> a flaw. How parents present themselves also has an influences to our behaviour or how we reveal ourselves</p>

  <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">THE DIFFICULTIES TEENAGERS FACE</span></h5>
  <p>Lets be honest most teenagers are constantly moody and this definately will get on any parents nerve,before letting it get to even though it is annoying,how about you consider the fact they might be in need of help.Do go and ask whats wrong trust me its not easy to speak about the problem.Think of it like this would it be easy for you to tell your child that his/her mom passed away or dad passed away, no right thats how they feel when you ask whats wrong.The best way to deal with this would ask for their input from different scenario's, when thing ive noticed about most teenagers they get personal when soloving an issue that their are facing.The tone of thier voice,body language will change if solving a scenario thats personal to them.</p>
  </div>
<p>Here is a list of problems they might be facing:
<ol>
  <li>Bullying</li>
  <li>Acceptance</li>
  <li>Depression</li>
  <li>Anxiety</li>
  Yes this issues can be interlinked and there are many more then this issues that can face.This could be from many reasons even you can be at fault,yes you can be at fault.Parents constantly put their children under stress unintentionly, you wont see it but it kills them and you do it alot. e.g Their school marks for example, all parents want their kids to be the best and top of their class but at what cost, other kids dont even know how to balance their social life and academic life because the want to excel in academics and hear me parents this has negative effect.
